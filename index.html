                <h3>Lemon Meringue Pie</h3>
                <p>Now, my mom would be very upset if she knew I was sharing this recipe, so let's keep it just between us! This is my great grandmother's lemon meringue pie, which means the recipe is simple and kind of vague. But it's truly unlike any other lemon meringue pie I've ever had and a staple at family events during the summer. Sweet, tart, and refreshing!</p>

                    <h4>Directions</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add lemons and boil until they are just hot. Remove from pot.</li>
                        <li>Once the lemons are cool enough to tough, start juicing them. Juice enough lemons until you have &frac12; cup of lemon juice.</li>
                        <li>Preheat oven to 325.</li>
                        <li>Separate the 2 egg yolks from the whites. Place the whites in medium bowl and place in the refridgerator. In a large bowl, beat together the can of sweetened condensed milk and egg yolks. Stir in the lemon juice until thick. Pour into the crust.</li>
                        <li>Next, beat the set aside egg whites until light and fluffy. Top the pie with the meringue.</li>
                        <li>Bake until meringue is lightly browned, around 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4>Tips</h4>
                    <p>As I said before, my great grandmother's recipe is kind of vague. I tried to add as much detail as I could to this version. But that's the way all of her recipes were, or at least the ones she chose to write down. My mom says that I'm the only person in the family that has ever come close to cooking like her, and I take that as a major compliment. So with that in mind, I feel like I have some justification to give you these tips.</p>
                    <p>Never use lemon juice out of the bottle! It's always, always better with the fresh stuff.</p>
                    <p>Six lemons is an estimate of how many you will need. We always just buy the pre-bagged bunches and it seems to be enough. If you are scant a couple of tablespoons, go ahead and supplement with some bottled lemon juice.</p>
                    <p>The meringue is the hardest part. I've never gotten the texture quite right, but it always still tastes great! So if yours looks a little strange, just go with it!</p>
                    <p>Lastly, I suggest peeking at the pie in the oven every couple of minutes. My great grandmother didn't specify a time, so we are always left sitting in front of the oven with the light on inside making sure it doesn't overcook.</p>
                    <p>You can also make this pie with a regular frozen pie crust. Just make sure to parbake your crust first.</p>

                <p>This apple pie is by far the best I've ever had. It's a labor of love, but totally worth every second spent making it! It is a <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/bas-best-deep-dish-apple-pie">recipe by Claire Safitz</a> with a few of my own tweaks included.</p>

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h4>Directions</h4>
                    <ol >
                        <li>Peel and slice apples. Apple slices should be around &frac18; inch thick.</li>
                        <li>In a large bowl, mix together sliced apples, the sugars, lemon juice, all spices, and salt until apples are nicely coated. Let sit in refridgerator for 1 to 3 hours until apples have released juices.</li>
                        <li>Once your apples have released their juices, start making the filling. Pour the apple cider into a small pot. Split the vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape the seeds into the pot, then add the pod. Bring to a boil, whisking occasionally. Cook until reduced by about two&#45;thirds. Pour any juices from your apples into the pot until reduced to about a &frac12; cup. Remove from heat and remove vanilla pod.</li>
                        <li>In the meantime, take out frozen pie shell and pie dough. Set aside.</li>
                        <li>In a small bowl, stir cornstarch into 3 tablespoons of water until dissolved. Whisk into cider mixture. Cook cider mixture over medium&#45;low heat, whisking constantly, until thick and bubbling. It should resemble caramel and have a dark amber color. Remove from heat and let sit for 1 to 2 minutes. Pour over apples and mix until coated.</li>
                        <li>The edge of your pie shell should be slightly maleable. Press down on the crimped edge to flatten it. The edge should now extend a little bit over the edge of the pan. Unroll your refridgerated pie dough.</li>
                        <li>Pour the apple filling into the pie shell. The apples will form a large, tall dome in the center. Cut up butter into a few pats and place them randomly on top of the filling.</li>
                        <li>Beat your egg with 1 teaspoon of water. brush the visible edges of the pie shell with the egg wash. Next, place the refridgerated pie dough round on top of the apple dome. Bring edges down to meet the edges of the pie shell. Fold the edges of the shell over the pie dough round and crimp with a fork or your fingers to seal. Do this all the way around.</li>
                        <li>Cut small slits on the top of the dough to vent steam released by the apples. Lightly brush top of dough with egg wash making sure there are no pools of egg around the edges. Sprinkle raw sugar.</li>
                        <li>Preheat oven to 375. While the oven heats, place pie on a foil&#45;lined baking sheet and chill in freezer until oven is up to temperature &#40;around 10 minutes&#41;.</li>
                        <li>Bake on baking sheet for 1&frac12; to 2 hours, untill juices are thick and bubbling and the crust is a deep golden brown.</li>
                        <li>Let cool for at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4>Tips</h4>
                    <p>Having made this pie a few times, I've come up with a few tips that might help you along the way.</p>
                    <p>First, Pink Lady apples are the best for this pie. They have a flavor profile that pairs incredibly with the spices in this recipe. If you can't find Pink Ladies, Granny Smith, Honeycrisp, and Stayman apples are all good substitutes.</p>
                    <p>Always use a vanilla bean, not extract. You just can't duplicate that flavor!</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>If your dough starts getting too warm during the assembly, stick the pie in the freezer for a few minutes. The heat from the apple cider reduction can make this part tricky.</p>
                    <p>During baking, if you think the crust is getting too dark, place some foil over the pie. This will prevent burning.</p>
                    <p>I always make this a double recipe and make two pies. When doing this, you still only need 1 vanilla bead &#40;although I still sometimes use 2&#41; and 1 egg, and you don't have to buy any extra dough since most pie shells and pie dough rounds come in doubles.</p>

                    <h4>Tips</h4>
                    <p>There aren't many tips for this recipe as we stay pretty true to the original. The only thing we've picked up on over the years is that this double recipe makes more than can fit in two deep dish pie shells. So we now also buy a regular pie shell and bake it on the rack underneath the two deep dish pies.</p>
                    <p>Always serve with a generous portion of fresh whipped cream!</p>

                <h3>Chocolate Pecan Pie</h3>
                <p>The absolute best pecan pie in the world is Cracker Barrel's Chocolate Pecan Pie. I know that's a very bold statement, and I wish it weren't true, but this is the reality we all must face! Sadly, the other reality I must face is that I grew up in the middle of nowhere. There was nary a Cracker Barrel in sight, so my family had to get crafty.</p>
                <p>For the past almost decade, we have been using this <a href="https://copykat.com/cracker-barrel-chocolate-pecan-pie/#comments">recipe by Stephanie Manley</a> to recreate the magic of Cracker Barrel's pie and it's a major hit! The only requirement is you must serve the pie with lots of vanilla ice cream!</p>

                        <li >Pour filling gently over the pecans and chips. Pouring too fast will disturb the layer you just made.</li>
                        <li >Bake for 60 to 75 minutes. You'll know it's done when only the center jiggles a little bit. Pecans should rise to the top during baking. If crust begins getting too dark before the center is set, place a piece of foil over the pie.</li>
